Hi folks,

Coming with a very simple script to fetch SSL certificate status of domains from command line. Script output status is email ready, so that it will be helpful for automatic monitoring and audits.

Steps :
```
git clone
cd
open domains.txt in your favorite text editor and add your domains one by one
save the file 
./
```

If the host server is cPanel hosted and ned to fetch SSL status of domains from that server, just uncomment line number 4 and 5 from script file.
